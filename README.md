# Fighting Game Strike Predictor

This repository contains code for a rule-based machine learning system that predicts a human opponent's next strike in a martial arts fighting game. The model uses the two most recent strikes in the player's history to make a prediction about the most likely next strike. The system also has a learning capability, allowing it to improve its predictions over time as it gathers more information about the player's strike patterns.
